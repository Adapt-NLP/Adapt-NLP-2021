    <h2>Multiple Submission Policy</h2>
    <p>
        Dual submissions with the main conference are allowed. 
        Authors must declare dual submission between the Adapt-NLP workshop and the main conference by entering the paper’s main conference submission ID. 
        The reviews from the main conference will be automatically forwarded to the workshop and taken into consideration when the paper is evaluated. 
        Authors of dual-submission papers accepted to the main conference should retract them from the workshop by ???.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Papers that will be under consideration for other venues during the Adapt-NLP reviewing period must also be declared at submission time. 
        If a paper is accepted for publication at DeeLIO, it must be immediately withdrawn from other venues. 
        If a paper under review at Adapt-NLP is accepted elsewhere and authors intend to proceed there, the Adapt-NLP committee must be notified immediately.
