    <h2>Submissions</h2> 
    <p>
        We invite the submission of long and short papers on original and unpublished research in any topic related with 
        the main workshop topics. Long papers may consist of up to 8 pages of content + references. 
        Short papers may consist of up to 4 pages of content + references. 
        Upon acceptance, both types of papers will be given one additional page of content. 
        Authors are encouraged to use this additional page for addressing reviewers’ comments in the final version.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The workshop will have two tracks: archival and non-archival.  
        The archival track is aimed for original and new contributions while the non-archival track is aimed for papers that have already been published, 
        or work in progress that will be later submitted to archival venues. 
        In both tracks, we welcome both empirical and theoretical papers, as well as opinion and discussion papers.
