    <p>
        Adapt-NLP aims to bring together researchers and ideas in the broad spectrum of NLP research in domain adaptation, 
        zero-shot transfer learning and related setups where the data distribution differs between the train and test phases. 
        We believe there is much to gain by organizing this workshop, gathering a forum to share insights and discuss issues that arecommon across them. 
        We plan to focus on topics such as unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches to adaptation and transfer, 
        as well as the similarities and differences between domain adaptation and cross-lingual learning. 
        We would also like to explore the definitions of fundamental con-cepts such as the concepts of domain, 
        transfer aswell as zero-shot and few-shot learning.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
        
        <ul>
            <li>Introducing algorithms for DA, focusing on unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches.</li> 
            <li>Similarities and differences between DA and cross-lingual learning.</li> 
            <li>Definitions of fundamental concepts such as the concepts of domain, transfer as well as zero-shot and few-shot learning.</li> 
            <li>Zero-shot and few-shot learning algorithms and their resemblance to unsupervised-DA.</li> 
            <li>Introducing new setup definitions for DA tasks. Aiming toward realistic and applicable scenarios, such as one-to-many DA, many-to-many DA and DA when the target domain is unknown.</li> 
            <li>New tasks and new domains that have not yet been explored in the proposed setups.</li> 
        </ul>
