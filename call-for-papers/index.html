    <h2>Call For Papers</h2>
    
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        The growth in computational power and the rise of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
        The ability to collect massive dataset with the capacity to train big models on powerful GPUs, has yielded NLP-based technology that was beyond 
        imagination only a few years ago.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        However, many NLP algorithms rely on the fundamental assumption that the training and the test sets follow the same underlying distribution. 
        When these distributions do not match, a phenomenon known as domain shift, such models are likely to encounter performance drops. 
        Despite the growing availability  of heterogeneous data, many NLP domains still lack the amounts of labeled data required to feed data-hungry 
        neural models, and in some domains and languages even unlabeled data is scarce. As a result, the problem of domain adaptation, 
        training an algorithm on annotated data from one or more source domain and  applying it to other target domains, is a fundamental NLP challenge.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The topics of the workshop include, but are not restricted to:
                 
        <ul>
            <li>Novel DA algorithms, for existing as well as new setups.</li> 
            <li>Extending DA research to new domains and tasks through both novel datasets and algorithmic approaches.</li> 
            <li>Proposing novel zero-shot and few-shot  algorithms and discussing their relevance for DA.</li> 
            <li>Exploring the similarities and differences between algorithmic approaches to DA, cross-lingual and cross-task learning.</li> 
            <li>A conceptual discussion of the definitions of fundamental concepts such as domain, transfer as well as zero-shot and few-shot learning.</li> 
            <li>Introducing and exploring novel or under-explored DA setups, aiming towards realistic and applicable ones (e.g., one-to-many DA, many-to-many DA and DA when the target domain is unknown when training on the source domain).</li> 
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Important Dates:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Jan 18, 2021 – Submission deadline.</li> <br>
<!--         <li>??? ??, 2021 – Retraction of workshop papers accepted for ???.</li> <br> -->
        <li>Feb 18, 2021 – Notification of acceptance.</li> <br>
        <li>Mar 1, 2021 – Camera-ready papers due.</li> <br>
        <li>April 19-20, 2021 – Workshop Dates</li> <br>
    </ul>
    Note: All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00.
    
        <h3>Submissions</h3> 
    <p>
        We invite the submission of long and short papers on original and unpublished research in any topic related with 
        the main workshop topics. Long papers may consist of up to 8 pages of content + references. 
        Short papers may consist of up to 4 pages of content + references. 
        Upon acceptance, both types of papers will be given one additional page of content. 
        Authors are encouraged to use this additional page for addressing reviewers’ comments in the final version.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The workshop will have two tracks: archival and non-archival.  
        The archival track is aimed for original and new contributions while the non-archival track is aimed for papers that have already been published, 
        or work in progress that will be later submitted to archival venues. 
        In both tracks, we welcome both empirical and theoretical papers, as well as opinion and discussion papers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Papers should follow the official EACL 2021 style guidelines and should be submitted via softconf. \\
        Submission link: To be announced.

    <h3>Multiple Submission Policy</h3>
    <p>
        Dual submissions with the main conference are allowed. 
        Authors must declare dual submission between the Adapt-NLP workshop and the main conference by entering the paper’s main conference submission ID.  
<!--         Authors of archival track papers accepted to the main conference should retract from the workshop by ???.   -->
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We will add more details upon workshop acceptance.
